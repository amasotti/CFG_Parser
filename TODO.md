# TO DO

## General
+ <del>Find nicer ways to check for duplicates in trees (Parser) and in self.rules_dict (Grammar)<del>
+ <del>Implement a function to draw parsed sentences as tree<del>
+ Implement probabilistic CFG

## Classes

### Parser
+ <del>Check if everything is ok with the method `self.to_tree` (in Parser), then delete `self.print_tree()`<del>
+ <del>The Parsing should search for alternative paths<del>
+ <del>Trees, as returned by `to_tree()` should be tuples: (number, tree), to allow for further process<del>
+ Allow self.input (Parser) to parse  more than one sentence in batch

### Grammar
+ <del>Remove duplicates from `self.rules_dict`<del>
+ <del>Class implementation for Grammar<del>
### Rules

+ <del> Import and modify large rule list from [usami/pcfg](https://github.com/usami/pcfg) and test it</del>
